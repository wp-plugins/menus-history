Provides history of changes to Wordpress menus

== Description ==

The Menus History plugin provides history of changes to Wordpress menus items. The history information may be useful in restoring deleted or misplaced menu items. 

To maximize the benefit of this plugin, install it on new Wordpress set ups. The information it provides can be extremely useful particularly when database back-ups are not available. Once activated, it keeps track of the following.

* Item arrangement
* Navigation labels
* Title attributes
* CSS classes
* Description
* URL
* Item targets
* Link relationships

Please note the plugin's limitations.

* The plugin must be activated prior to making changes to your menus. Changes done before the plugin had been activated would not be shown. 
* The plugin doesn't provide the ability to restore menus; it only shows history information. You still need to manually restore your menus.
* Deleted menus are also removed from the plugin's menu list.
